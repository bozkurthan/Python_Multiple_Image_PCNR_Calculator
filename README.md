# Python_Multiple_Image_PCNR_Calculator
The framework is prepared for the more than one image calculation.

Basically, use psnr.py to extract PCNR values of multi image. The main purpose of this repo is that I want to compare each image with the groundtruth image. So, I created this script to save time by using for loop.  Also, you can set number of image instance to calculate PSNR values. 

Requirement: OpenCV python.

Please free to contact for improvements.

Cheers!!
